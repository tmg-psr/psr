# Style Guide for Documentation

Last Updated: 31 July 2024

This will serve as the suggested template for all writeups and psr documentation (NOT including route notes) in this repository.
This won't be enforced, but having the same format for all documentation enables easier and more strategic reading.

## Format
Documents are expected to follow a certain output format.
* **Use markdown**, unless there's a specific reason to use another file type or format.
  If you've never used markdown before, visit [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org) to get started.
* **Include a title**. The title should be 10 words or less, or at least fit on one markdown line.
* **Include an "About" section**. See [above](#about) as an example. Include:
  * **Author**. SRC/Twitch/Discord usernames are all acceptable, as long as they are well-identifying.
  * **Last updated date** to identify potentially outdated/unfresh documents. Prefer \<day> \<month, written out> \<year>. 
  * **A brief introduction** to the document. Ideally a few sentences to overview what the document will cover.
* **Use headings to organize.** Use -- Section -- breakers for non-markdown files.
* **Use footnotes where necessary**. Markdown supports footnotes and convenient re-directs; use them where you can.

## Markdown code and other text guidelines
Raw text/code is expected to be spaced and organized to be readable and easily editable.
* There's no hard-set line limit, but **100 characters is the suggestion** for longer paragraphs.
  * Prefer line breaks between sentences or clauses.
